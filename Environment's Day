World Environment Day (also called as WED) has been started celebrating as an annual event on every 5th of June 
since 1973 in order to raise the global awareness about the importance of the healthy and green environment in
the human lives, to solve the environmental issues by implementing some positive environmental actions as well as to
make aware common public worldwide that everyone is responsible for saving his environment and not only somebody,
government or organizations working for it.
